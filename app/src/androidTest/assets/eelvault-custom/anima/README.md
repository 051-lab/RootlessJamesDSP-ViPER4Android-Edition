# ANIMA — Vintage Harmonic Engine

**Version:** 1.0.2
**Status:** Definitive
**Type:** Fixed-parameter analog emulation
**Target:** RootlessJamesDSP / JDSP4Linux
**File:** `anima.eel`

## Description

ANIMA is a fixed-parameter, program-dependent analog emulation processor. It transforms sterile digital audio into warm, dimensional, vintage-sounding output by emulating the behavior of transformer-coupled analog gear, tape machines, and optical compressors.

ANIMA has no user-adjustable parameters. It is a "magic box" — you load it, and it works. All parameters are hard-coded to their psychoacoustically optimal values.

## Signal Flow

## Installation

### RootlessJamesDSP (Android)

1. Copy `anima.eel` to your RootlessJamesDSP Liveprog scripts directory.
2. Enable the Liveprog effect.
3. Select `anima.eel` from the script dropdown.

### JDSP4Linux (Linux Desktop)

```bash
jamesdsp --set liveprog_enable=true
jamesdsp --set 'liveprog_file=/path/to/anima.eel'
```

## Psychoacoustic Design Principles

- **Even-harmonic saturation** generates musically consonant overtones (2nd, 4th harmonics) perceived as warmth and body, following the principles described in *Designing Audio Effect Plug-Ins in C++*.
- **Dynamic tilt EQ** applies Fletcher-Munson equal-loudness compensation: when the signal gets loud, highs are gently reduced and lows are gently boosted to maintain perceived balance.
- **Micro-flutter** uses the Haas effect: delays under 5 ms are perceived as thickness and motion rather than discrete echoes, following spatial hearing principles from *Principles and Applications of Spatial Hearing*.
- **Thermal hysteresis** emulates the "memory" behavior of analog optical compressors, where sustained loudness slows the release time.
- **4-point Hermite interpolation** preserves high-frequency content during delay modulation, following the fractional delay line techniques described in *The Audio Programming Book*.

## Known Limitations

- Saturation stage is not oversampled. The 14 kHz tape damping filter placed after the saturation stage attenuates high-frequency aliasing artifacts.
- Limiter uses a lightweight ISP estimator rather than a full ITU-R BS.1770 4x oversampled True Peak meter.
- Flutter delay uses linear interpolation in the stable build. Hermite interpolation is available in the enhanced build.
