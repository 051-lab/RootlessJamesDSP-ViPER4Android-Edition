# ANIMA Changelog

All notable changes to ANIMA will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.2] - v1.0.2 Final Production (DEFINITIVE)

### Changed
- Replaced per-sample sin() LFO evaluation with recursive quadrature oscillators. Eliminates 96,000 transcendental function calls per second at 48 kHz. Flutter stage CPU cost reduced by approximately 90%.
- Added periodic quadrature renormalization (every 48,000 samples) to prevent single-precision float32 radius drift caused by cos(delta) rounding to 1.0.
- Precomputed LFO rotation constants in [init](init).
- Removed phase accumulator variables (lfo1, lfo2, lfo1Inc, lfo2Inc).
- Renamed Stage 6 from "Fletcher-Munson" to "Level-Dependent Warmth Tilt" for technical accuracy.
- Added sample-rate behavior documentation to Stage 4 tape filter comments.
- Renamed "FIXED DEFINITIVE PARAMETERS" to "FIXED PARAMETERS".
- Simplified NaN protection syntax.

### Added
- Explicit header documentation noting the 1.65–2.35 ms all-wet modulated delay latency (Haas effect fusion zone) and warning against uncompensated parallel mixing.
- Clarifying comments explaining the single-precision floating-point mechanics of the quadrature renormalization step.

### Preserved
- All parameter values identical to v1.0.1.
- 14 kHz tape filter coefficient formula unchanged (voicing intentionally preserved at mobile rates).
- All processing stages acoustically identical to v1.0.1.

### Peer Review Note
- v1.0.2 is mathematically and acoustically equivalent to v1.0.1. Due to differing finite-precision accumulation paths (recursive rotation vs. phase addition), the modulation signal is not guaranteed to be strictly bit-identical to v1.0.1 over long durations.

## [1.0.1] - v1.0.1 Corrective Release (DEFINITIVE)

### Fixed
- Critical: LFO2 phase discontinuity eliminated. Frequency multiplication (1.7x) moved into the oscillator increment. Sine evaluation changed from sin(lfo2 * 1.7 + 1.3) to sin(lfo2 + 1.3). Removes audible glitch every ~4.3 seconds.
- Critical: LFO2 double phase offset removed. Initialization changed from 1.3 to 0. Phase offset is now applied only in the sine argument.
- Important: DC blocker separated from musical high-pass. Post-saturation DC removal now uses a dedicated 5 Hz coefficient instead of reusing the 30 Hz HPF coefficient. Eliminates the double 30 Hz high-pass that was attenuating sub-bass.

### Added
- Non-finite input protection (NaN and Infinity sanitizer) at the input stage.
- Precomputed LFO increments in [init](init) for improved clarity.
- Dedicated dcBlockHz parameter (5 Hz) in [init](init).

### Changed
- Redundant division (1 / tapeGain) replaced with direct expression (1 + tapeAmt * env) in auto makeup target calculation. Removes one per-sample division.
- Saturation stage comments updated to "Asymmetric Mixed-Harmonic Saturation" for technical accuracy.
- Limiter comments updated to "Transition-Aware Safety Limiter" for technical accuracy.
- Thermal Hysteresis comments updated to "Program-Dependent Release" for technical accuracy.

### Deferred to v1.1.0
- Recursive quadrature LFO oscillator (performance optimization).
- Low-rate LFO evaluation with interpolation (performance optimization).
- Sine lookup table (performance optimization).
